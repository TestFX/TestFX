/**
 * Enumeration holding the three simplest types of motion between two 2D points
 * a = (x₁, y₁) and b = (x₂, y₂). Given any two points in the plane we can construct
 * a right-angled triangle where the hypotenuse is the straight-line between a and b.

 * Traveling in a straight-line between a and b (that is, tracing the hypotenuse) is
 * {@code DIRECT}. Traveling first from a to c and then from c to b is {@code HORIZONTAL_FIRST}.
 * Traveling first from a to d and then from d to b is {@code VERTICAL_FIRST}. {@code DEFAULT}
 * means that no specific type of motion was explicitly requested.
